# CADRE - Code Repository

Welcome to the CADRE code repository, maintained by researchers at The Brown University School of Public Health! 

## About CADRE

This codebase was developed for NIH-funded projects that aim to model the social networks of persons involved with the criminal legal system (PCLS).
* The [first](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/DKQSaMna9U2-D1GPVdwZoA/project-details/10488980) of these focuses, funded by NIGMS, is modeling tobacco smoking and alcohol use in the networks of PCLS. 
* A [second](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/p94t_kwSokGrAaxrbNLTig/project-details/10879972) project, supported by NIMHD, is building upon this codebase to simulate the impact of social network dynamics on COVID-19 testing and vaccination among PCLS.
