Purpose: To determine if missing agents at time 1 are
not due to skipping nodes without edges. 

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "/Users/adityakhanna/Google Drive/My Drive/code/cadre/python")
```

Read in the data:

```{r}
library(network)
net <- read.table("network.txt", skip = 10001, row.names = NULL)
head(net)
dim(net)
head(cbind(net[,1],net[,2]), 25)
```
Unique IDs in the edgelist at the start:

```{r}
nodes_in_edgelist <- c(net[,1], net[,2])
length(nodes_in_edgelist)

unique_nodes_in_edgelist <- unique(nodes_in_edgelist)
length(unique_nodes_in_edgelist)
```

Each node has at least one edge at the start. So missing agents at time 1 are
not due to skipping nodes without edges.
